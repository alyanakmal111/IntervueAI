// corn job explanation
// cron jobs are scheduled tasks that run periodically at specified intervals.
// we want to send 1 get request every 14 minutes to the API_URL

// how to define a "schedule" for a cron job
// the schedule is defined using a cron expression, which consists of five fields separated by spaces

// the five fields are as follows:
// -> Minute, Hour, Day of the month, Month, Day of the week

//* 14 * * * * - every 14 minutes
//* 0 0 * * 0 - at midnight on Sundays
//* 30 3 15 * * - at 3:30 AM on the 15th of every month
//* 0 0 1 * * - at midnight on the first day of every month
//* 0 0 * * * - at midnight every day
//* 0 0 1 1 * - at midnight on January 1st every year
//* 0 * * * * - every hour at the start of the hour
